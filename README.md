# days-until
Minimalistic web app that displays a countdown towards a configured datetime

Demo: http://jmakhack.github.io/days-until/

This project was originally developed as a countdown to a departure to Japan and was primarily used as a browser homepage.
The design is kept as simplistic as possible in terms of both UI and code.
Feel free to fork this project and edit it for your own use cases.
